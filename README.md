In this assignment we create a HashTable to store the entry UINS from students taken from a excel .csv file. Then we use the HashTable to search for specific UINs and enter their corresponding grade values. The output of this program is a final csv file that contains the quiz values for those students that completed the quiz and submitted their score. I also included some statistics for the table that include the minimum, maximum and average length of the linkedlists within the HashTable.
